# plugging and unplugging the USB hub.  Or if power levels
# are insufficient to start attached devices, but gradually
# improve. In this case, the USB hub does not automatically re-enumerate
# devices, even though it might now have sufficient power to operate
# them.  The only solution is to reboot.  This check should not
# be performed too often.  Perhaps every 15 minutes.
