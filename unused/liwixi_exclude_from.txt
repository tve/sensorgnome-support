# liwixi exclusions for a Sensorgnome RPi
#
# This file provides a list of files and paths we don't want to include
# in a liwixi distribution we generate from the current SG.
# Its name is passed to the pliwixi script via an environment variable
# set in /root/.bashrc like so:
#
#   export LIWIXI_EXCLUDE_FROM=/home/pi/proj/sensorgnome/liwixi_exclude_from.txt

# exclude data files, which are stored in the SGdata directory of SD
# card's one and only partition
/boot/SGdata/**

# ssh keys for the development git repo at acadiau.ca
/home/pi/.ssh/id_dsa_sgpidev**

# ssh keys and the tunnel port assignment from this SG's self-registration with sensorgnome.org
/home/pi/.ssh/id_dsa
/home/pi/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
/home/pi/.ssh/tunnel_port
