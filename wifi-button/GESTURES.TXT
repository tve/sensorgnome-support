# If a file called GESTURES.TXT exists in the config dir, then the gesture service
# is run.  This detects pushbutton gestures on a switch wired to a GPIO pin and signals
# status to an LED wired to another GPIO pin.
# 
# If GESTURES.TXT is missing, the WiFi hotspot turns on at every boot (and never turns off).

# Configuration:
GEST_LED_GPIO=17  # GPIO pin for LED
GEST_SW_GPIO=18   # GPIO pin for N.O. switch contact
# Important: on the rPi the GEST_SW_GPIO pin must have a pull-up enabled in a Device tree
# Overlay (dtbo file). Thus the value above cannot be simply changed: the device tree needs to be
# amended as well (or an external pull-up resistor used).

# The recommended switch is:  https://www.adafruit.com/product/559
# and it is wired like so:
# 
# "+"         = LED power                    -> GPIO 17 (or other depending on config)
# "-", COMMON = LED GND and switch GND       -> GND  (two terminals going to ground)
# "NO"        = Switch normally-open contact -> GPIO 18 (or other as configured)
# 
# Device-tree fragments are loaded to ensure the internal pull-up
# resistor is enabled on the "NO" pin so that grounding the NO pin is
# considered "on".  
# 
# The adafruit switch's LED includes an internal resistor to limit current.
# If you roll your own LED, make sure to do something similar (typ range is 330Ω-2KΩ).
# 
# The following gestures are supported:
# 
# single click: toggle a 1/s heartbeat of the LED as well as rapid
#               blinks for detected tag pulses.  Turns off automatically
#               after 10 minutes
# 
# double click: toggle the WiFi hotspot to start/stop a
#               WPA2-protected access point with the SG serial number
#               as both ssid and passphrase, e.g. SG-26F1RPI358CC.
#               The SG has the address 192.168.7.2 when connecting
#               wirelessly.  When the hotspot is on, the LED blinks on and
#               off every 0.9 seconds.
# 
#               Turns off automatically after 30 minutes.
# 
# hold 3 sec: perform a clean shutdown; the LED will light and stay
#               lit until shutdown is complete, and then turns off.
# 
# See gestures.js and pushbtn.js for details.
