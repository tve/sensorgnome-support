# This file lets you set up a WiFi client connection for your SGPi.
# This connection is independent from the SGPi's WiFi hotspot (see NOTES below).
#
# If you DO NOT want the SGPi to connect to a local WiFi network, leave the
# WIFI_SSID (network name) empty (this is the default).
# If you DO want the SGPi to connect to a local WiFi network, set the WIFI_SSID to the
# network'/'s name / SSID and set the WIFI_PASS to the network's password. The password
# must be at least 8 characters long (this is a general WiFi requirement) and it
# is required. The network must be WPA/WPA2 password protected, and open network will
# not be accepted.
#

# WiFi SSID / network name, leave blank for no connection (default)
WIFI_SSID=
# Example: WIFI_SSID=MyWifi

# WiFi password (use quotes if the password contains spaces or special characters)
WIFI_PASS=
# Example: WIFI_PASS="very Secure!"

# WiFi 2-letter country code (CA, US, GB, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
# Used to enable the correct frequency bands
WIFI_COUNTRY=US

# NOTES
# =====
#
# By default, the SGPi's WiFi adapter is off, but if you provided SSID/password above,
# then the SGPi tries to maintain a connection to sensorgnome .org via the WiFi network.
# This keeps the WiFi adapter on all the time, which will increase power consumption.
#
# Changing the WiFi info above requires rebooting the rPi to take effect.

# SGPi WiFi HOTSPOT - activate
# ============================
#
# The SGPi's WiFi hotspot is independent of any WiFi client configured above
# and can be turned on by double-clicking the external button (the one with the LED ring).
# An active hotspot is indicated by the external button LED blinking on and off
# at 0.9 second intervals.
#
# The hotspot will have the SGPi's serial number as both its network name
# and its network passphrase, e.g.:
#
#  Hotspot Name:     SG-26F1RPI358CC
#  Hotspot Password: SG-26F1RPI358CC
#
# When the hotspot is on, you can connect to the SGPi from your laptop
# or phone WiFi menu.  After connecting to the SGPi hotspot, you can
# access the SGPi's interface page in a web browser using one or both
# of these URLs:
#
#   http://sgpi.local     - most Macs, linux boxes, Windows computers with iTunes
#   http://192.168.7.2    - all computers, phones
#
# You can also use FileZilla (https://filezilla-project.org/) to download
# data from the SGPi's WiFi hotspot using these options:
#
#   hostname: sftp://192.168.7.2
#   username: root
#   password: root
#
# Your SG's files can then be found in the /data/SGdata folder
#
# SGPi WiFi HOTSPOT - deactivate
# ==============================
#
# The WiFi hotspot will turn OFF when any of these events occur:
#
# - you double-click the external button.  This will also turn off the
#   0.9 second LED blinking.
#
# - the WiFi hotspot times out.  This happens 30 minutes after the
#   hotspot is activated, regardless of network activity.  This also
#   turns off the 0.9 second LED blinking.
#
# - the SGPi reboots.  After rebooting, the hotspot is off until it is
#   activated by double-clicking the button.
